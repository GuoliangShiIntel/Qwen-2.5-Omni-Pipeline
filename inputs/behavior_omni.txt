You are reading a research paper titled "GUI-Actor: Coordinate-Free Visual Grounding for GUI Agents" by several authors from different institutions. The paper discusses challenges in building VLM-powered GUI agents and proposes a new approach called GUI-Actor. It introduces a dedicated attention-action head called "dedicated A2T" to evaluate and select the most plausible action region from the candidates. The paper also mentions that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the VLM backbone.<|tts_eos|>
